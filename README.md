DESCRIPTION:
Realtime messaging app built using express, a node js frame work and socket.io on the backend, and vanilla JavaScript on the front end.
Socket.io is a library that enables real-time communication between clients and server.

Users are registered and identified using a 6 digit user ID chosen by the user upon entering a chat session. Multiple users in a chat session can't have the same ID.
This app lets different users join a chat room where in messages can be send and received.

Potential improvements for when I have a better understanding of backend technologies:
- User authentication
- Private messaging
- Integration with a database(eg: Mongodb) to retrieve old messages between users

// This is my first time working with the backend, feedbacks are welcome.
