DESCRIPTION:
Realtime messaging app built using express, a node js frame work and socket.io on the backend, and vanilla JavaScript on the front end.

Users are registered and identified using a 6 digit user ID chosen by the user. Multiple users in a chat session can't have the same ID.
This app lets different users join a chat room where in messages can be send and received.
